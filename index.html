        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born-Swiss inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion powered automobile in 1808. The modern car‚Äîa practical, marketable automobile for everyday use‚Äîwas invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.<br/>Invented: 1886<br/>
          Inventor: Carl Benz<br/>
          Wheels: 3‚Äì4<br/>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. <br/>Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            
            There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.[</p><br/>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>When an individual is learning how to drive a car, there are several things that they should keep in mind. Regardless of whether one is a seasoned or rookie driver, it is imperative to be aware of certain aspects when one is behind the steering wheel.
              
              <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several individuals know how to drive an automatic car but are not comfortable behind the wheels of a manual one. The opposite holds true as well. Therefore, to help out all individuals, this article will illustrate all vital aspects of driving both these types of cars.</p><br/><br/>

              <center><img src="D:\car\8.jpg"height="250px" /></center>

                <p>1:Adjust driver seat and mirrors as per preference.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2:Put on a seatbelt and engage the parking or emergency brake.<br/>
                3:Get familiarised with the gear shift pattern mentioned on the gear-lever and try a mock gear change to get the hang of it. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4:Besides this, one must also ensure that they are on a level field to avoid rolling back or ahead. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&
                5:After doing all of these, individuals looking for answers on how to drive a car in India, can proceed with the steps to drive a manual and automatic car.</p><br/>
                <h2 class="heading"><center><b>How to Drive a Manual Car for the First Time?</b></center></h2><br/>
                <center><img src="D:\car\7.jpg"height="250px"/></center><br/></p>
                <p>Follow these steps if you are looking for how to drive a manual car for beginners:
                </p>
<h2  class="heading">Step 1: Start a Car in Neutral</h2><p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start the vehicle in neutral, turn on the ignition key to crank the engine and depress the clutch pedal. Drivers might not have to depress the clutch for switching on an older car model, but most modern cars are engineered in a way that it is necessary to engage the clutch before starting the engine.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice also ensures that a vehicle will not give any hiccups while starting, even if a driver forgets to put the gearbox in neutral.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 2: Shift into First Gear</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the engine running, drivers must engage the clutch entirely with their left foot and shift the gear-lever into first gear. At this point, individuals must use the left foot only for operating the clutch and the right foot for modulating brake pedals and accelerator.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 3: Get the Car in Motion</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a car in motion, drivers must disengage the parking brake while keeping the clutch pedal depressed. They must not accelerate at this point.
Now, drivers should start lifting the clutch pedal until they notice a drop in revs and clutch plates start coming in contact. This is also known as ‚Äòbite point‚Äô. Individuals searching on how to drive a car, should note that disengaging the clutch further at this point will make the vehicle crawl ahead without any accelerator input.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 4: Upshift into Higher Gears</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the car is in motion, release the accelerator and push down on the clutch. Then by following the shift pattern, change the gear-lever to second gear. After upshifting, disengage the clutch and begin applying moderate throttle inputs for maintaining momentum.
Individuals looking for how to drive a manual car must note that this entire procedure of engaging and releasing the clutch, modulating throttle inputs, etc. needs to be synchronised in quick succession.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 5: Downshift to Lower Gears</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car tends to shudder when stuck in a traffic jam and starts slowing down. In such cases, drivers must downshift a certain number of gears by following the same procedure - release the accelerator, depress the clutch and shift down to a lower gear.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 6: Stop a Manual Car</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To completely stop a manual car, disengage the accelerator and apply moderate force on the brake pedal to gradually downshift the gears to first gear. Once the vehicle is moving at a crawling speed, shift to neutral and allow it to freewheel without the involvement of any throttle input. Then allow the vehicle to come to a halt by engaging the clutch and depressing the brake completely.<br/></p>

<h3>Wondering what to do during an emergency situation?</h3><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While searching on how to drive a car, individuals  must note that they can stop a vehicle in any gear during an emergency situation by pushing down on their vehicle‚Äôs clutch and shifting it to neutral.</p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 7: Reversing a Manual Car</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, beginners having a search query on how to drive a car must ensure their vehicle is at a complete stop before shifting it to reverse gear. While reversing, they must check out that there is no vehicle or individual behind their vehicle before backing up.<br/></p>

<h2  class="heading">Step 8: Parking a Manual Car</h2><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike an automatic car, a manual one does not come with a ‚ÄòPark‚Äô gear. Therefore, it is imperative to engage a parking or emergency brake every time while parking a vehicle. Alternatively, drivers can also shift their vehicle into the reverse or first gear to prevent it from moving or rolling.</p><br/><br/>
